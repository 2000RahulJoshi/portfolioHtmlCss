# portfolioHtmlCss
This is the basic portfolio layout that I have created using html and CSS.

Whole website is divided into three parts :-
1- nav bar
2- middle section
3= footer


nav bar contains the information about basic details like works,blog,contact.
middle section contains the infomation like emp basic details, recent post and featured work.
footer contains the link of various social media plateform of the emp where we can contact her/him.
